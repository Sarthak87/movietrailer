# MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE

A webpage which displays a list of movies. It allows the users to watch their favourite movie trailers from a list of movies. 

 
## INSTALLATION

##### For Windows:
- Browse to http://www.python.org/download.
- Look for the Windows downloads, choose the one appropriate for your architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). At the time of writing, the choices are:
  - 32-bit: Python 2.7.9 Windows Installer
  - 64-bit: Python 2.7.9 Windows X86-64 Installer
- Run the installer and click through the prompts. Default options are usually just fine. This installs IDLE, too, by default.
##### For Linux:
- Python is installed by default, but sometimes IDLE is not. Either install IDLE using your distro's package manager, e.g. apt-get install idle (Ubuntu/Debian/etc.)

IDLE (Python GUI) and Python (command line) should now by in your program menu, under Python 2.7, and Python will be associated with .py files.
